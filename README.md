tmsj - Teach me some Japanese
=============================

A simple go program that parses a json for words or phrases you want to learn and outputs them into stdout.
I will primarily use this to learn Japanese by running it periodically somehow. It will therefore output a random phrase/word/kanji or something that I should learn.

It will probably work for most languages since you can just change the content of the json files.

TODO
====
Add flags to run different functionalities of the program such as:

	-Add support to repeatedly printing to file so that integration with conky scripts are possible
	-Flags that tell how many facts you want and which type
